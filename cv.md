## Code example
```
const difficultyLevel = e => {
	levels.forEach(item => item.classList.remove('active-level'));
	e.target.classList.add('active-level');
	level = e.target.dataset.level;

	let three = document.querySelector('[data-level="3"]');
	if (!e.target.dataset.level) {
		level = 3;
		three.classList.add('active-level');
	}
};
levels.forEach(item => addEventListener('click', difficultyLevel));
```
